# Magic Balls

## Description:

Magic balls appear out of **No Where** when the page is clicked. They *randomly* change their color and shape when they bounce off of walls. They are not subject to the forces of gravity, friction or air resistance and will keep on moving until the window is closed.

### Installation

Just load the page and left-click once to get started. You can click as many times as you want and each click will produce a ball. 

### Usage

The most common usage of this program is to have something to stare at while you procrastinate. It can also mesmerize you and help relieve stress. 

### Help

To find help with this project please email Susan.Engin@gmail.com.

### Roadmap

In the future the balls will be made to bounce off of each other not just the wall boundaries. They will also be going at different random velocities that may change on bounce in order to produce a more random effect.
